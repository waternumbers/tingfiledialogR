# tingfiledialogsR

This R package is a wrapper for tinyfiledialogs a single file C code for
providing dialogs that look "correct" for your operating system.


This is work in progress, particulary:

- the code is not well tested on Windows or Mac.
- the default switch to console input when GUI elements are not available will
cause R to crash

The latest developmental code can be installed with

`devtools::install_github("waternumbers/tinyfiledialogsR")`

Feel free to raise an issue or pull request to address these or any other
problems.

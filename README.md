# tingfiledialogR
R wrapper for tinyfiledialog C code

This is WIP, particulary:

- This is not tested on Windows or Mac
- the tinyfiledialog authors are not fully acknowledged
- the licencing in not confirmed

The latest developmental code can be installed with

`devtools::install_github("waternumbers/tinyfiledialogR")`

Feel free to raise an issue or pull request to address these or any other
problems.
